<font size=4>&emsp;&emsp;I am currently a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Resource Exploration Engineering from China University of Petroleum in Beijing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in igneous petrology. My previous research involves exploring the petrogenesis of the early Cretaceous adakities in Northeast China and the tectonic setting at that time by the distribution, petrological characteristics, major and trace elements, and geochronological and isotopic data of the adakites. I am now focusing on physical evolution of the lunar anorthositic crust and cumulate mantle inferred from trace element geochemical modeling, and apatite-melt trace element partitioning experiments.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Outside of research, I go fishing at least once a week. Driving around Knoxville to find high-quality fishing spots in the Tennessee River and nearby reservoirs is one of my biggest interests.</font>
