&emsp;&emsp;I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences of Rice University, working with [Dr. Rajdeep Dasgupta](https://www.dasgupta.rice.edu). I got my Master's degree in Geology from University of Tennessee, Knoxville with [Dr. Nicholas Dygert](https://dygert.utk.edu), and my Bachelor of Engineering in Resource Exploration Engineering from China University of Petroleum in Beijing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in experimental petrology and igneous geochemistry. My previous research involved: [1) conducting apatite-melt trace element partitioning experiments, and developing temperature and composition-dependent predictive partitioning model as well as Eu-in-apatite oxybarometers](https://dian01811.github.io/files/Ji_GCA_2024.pdf), [2) physical evolution of the lunar anorthositic crust and cumulate mantle inferred from trace element geochemical modeling](https://dian01811.github.io/files/Ji_EPSL_2023.pdf), and [3) exploring the petrogenesis of the early Cretaceous adakities in northeast China by their distribution, petrological, geochronological and isotopic characteristics](https://dian01811.github.io/files/Ji_IGR_2020.pdf). I am now focusing on high temperature and pressure experiments on sulfide solubility of young lunar basalts.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Outside of research, I go fishing at least once a week. Driving around in search of high-quality fishing spots and reservoirs to catch those strong bass, skipjack, catfish, trout and bluegill is my greatest interest.
