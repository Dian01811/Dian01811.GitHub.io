<font size=4>&emsp;&emsp;I am currently a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Resource Exploration Engineering from China University of Petroleum in Beijing.</font><br>&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in experimental petrology and igneous geochemistry. My previous research involved [1) the petrogenesis of the early Cretaceous adakities in Northeast China and the tectonic setting at that time by the distribution, petrological characteristics, geochronological and isotopic data of the adakites](https://dian01811.github.io/files/Ji_IGR_2020.pdf), and [2) physical evolution of the lunar anorthositic crust and cumulate mantle inferred from trace element geochemical modeling](https://dian01811.github.io/files/Ji_EPSL_2023.pdf). I am now focusing on apatite-melt trace element partitioning experiments and trying to build a temperature and composition-dependent predictive partitioning model as well as a Eu in apatite-melt oxybarometer.<br>
