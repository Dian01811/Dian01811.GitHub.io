<font size=4>&emsp;&emsp;I am currently a graduate student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in the department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. I got my Bachelor of Engineering in Resource Exploration Engineering from China University of Petroleum in Beijing.<br>&emsp;&emsp;I am interested in igneous geochemistry and experimental petrology. My previous research involved [1) exploring the petrogenesis of the early Cretaceous adakities in Northeast China and the tectonic setting at that time by the distribution, petrological characteristics, geochronological and isotopic data of the adakites] (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00206814.2019.1697968), and [2) physical evolution of the lunar anorthositic crust and cumulate mantle inferred from trace element geochemical modeling] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2022.117958). I am now focusing on apatite-melt trace element partitioning experiments and trying to build a temperature and composition-dependent predictive partitioning model as well as Eu in apatite-melt oxybarometer.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Outside of research, I go fishing at least once a week. Driving around Knoxville to find high-quality fishing spots in the Tennessee River and nearby reservoirs, and catching those strong bass, bluegill, catfish and trout is my greatest interest.</font>
