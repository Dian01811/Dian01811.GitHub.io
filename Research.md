## Eu anomalies in lunar anorthosites

<font size=4>&emsp;&emsp;We calculated REE and Eu distributions in lunar anorthosites according to recent fractional crystallization experiments and we find that crystalized plagioclase exhibit lager Eu anomalies than Apollo samples. Accoding to the numerical modeling, we suggest that subsolidus reequilibration after addition of a KREEP component reduces Eu anomalies and elevates Ce/Sm ratios, reproducing variations in the natural samples. Addition of a KREEP component may imply secondary magmatic processing of the lunar anorthosites, perhaps associated with Serial or Mg-suite Magmatism after a cumulate mantle overturn event.</font>


## The petrogenesis of early cretaceous adakitic rocks in Northeast China

<font size=4>&emsp;&emsp;Large volumes of Early Cretaceous adakitic rocks crop out in northeast China. In this paper, we summarize their spatial-temporal distribution and geochemical characteristics, which indicate significant Phanerozoic crust growth in NE China. Based on their geochemistry, these adakitic rocks are mainly derived from partial melting of juvenile lower crust. We interpret the melting to have resulted from extension and associated delamination and we thus propose a new two-stage convergent bidirectional subduction model.</font>
